yum centos ,apt Ubuntu
=======================

1. yum repolist  >>>> it will list the repositary list 

2. by default the ansible software is not available in the yum and all so we need the third pary repositary [epel]
   python is also needed for ansible but when we install the ansible automatically the python is also installed
   yum install epel-release -y >>>>>> to add the epel repo to the yum packages
     or
   sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

   yum install openssl   -y >>>>>>>
   yum install ansible -y  >>>>>> install the ansible
   ansible --version
   /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg   >>>>> home directory




sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version

manualy create a /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg    file if not create aytomatically
we need to give the sudo permissions to the user [NOPASSWD: ALL]  in visudo file for dont ask the password and all 


we need to setup tye oneway autentication 
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id  username@ipaddress
scp src username#ip:/path 

same user we need to work with ansible


groups
ip address

ansible groupname -m ping 
ansible all -m ping       >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
